1) The Code must contain a README.txt that explains the directory structure for Code. Note that this directory structure may be different from project to project, but it must be complete with regards to inclusion of all the source code (program source files, etc.), the deployable code (executables, web site files, etc.), and the like. For example, for a project with a Web site, the Code directory must have a subdirectory name WebSite that includes all the files on the Web site. As another example, if the project has a database, the Code directory must have a Database directory that includes a sql file that creates the database, tables, etc. and populates the database with the current data in this version of the project. (To make sure that you do not reveal some private data in your sql dump file, you must zip and password protect it. You would need to provide the password to me in a separate email.) This Code directory must also include a detailed Installation Guide that provides step by step instructions with screenshots showing how the project should be installed, what configuration files must be modified based on the environment, etc. Finally, it must include a User Manual document too.
